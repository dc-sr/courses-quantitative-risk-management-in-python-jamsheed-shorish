## The loss distribution

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "2045c6fc14"
disable_transition: false
```

`@part1`
* Loss distribution = frequency distribution of possible losses of a portfolio{{1}}
* Forex Example: portfolio value at creation is{{3}}
 * USD 100 x 1 EUR / USD  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= EUR 100{{3}}
- Risk factor = EUR / USD exchange rate{{4}}
- Random realizations of exchange rate => distribution of portfolio values in the future{{5}}

## Maximum Loss

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "4b5b89fed9"
```

`@part1`
- Given a portfolio with certain risk factors, what is the maximum amount it is likely to lose?
- "Likely" is vague--the best we can do is to specify a maximum loss with a certain level of confidence, since risk factors are stochastic.
- 100% confidence isn't useful: this only happens at the maximum loss it is possible to have!
- Instead, a confidence level of less than 100% is used, to answer questions such as:
- "What is the maximum loss that would take place 95% of the time?"
- In this question, the confidence level is 95%.

## Value at Risk (VaR)

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "58510a0903"
```

`@part1`
- VaR is a statistical measure that states the maximum loss a portfolio can sustain, for a particular confidence level.
- Typical confidence levels include 95%, 99%, and 99.5%. They are also represented as decimals between 0 and 1, where 0 = 0% and 1 = 100%.
- As decimals, 95% = 0.95, 99% = 0.99 and 99.5% = 0.995.
- Forex Example: If 99% of the time the EUR / USD exchange rate is no less than 0.50 EUR / USD, then the VaR for the portfolio at a confidence level of 0.99 is:

100 USD x 0.50 EUR / USD = 50 EUR.
