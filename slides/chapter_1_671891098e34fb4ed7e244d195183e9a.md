## The Loss Distribution

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "2045c6fc14"
disable_transition: false
```

`@part1`
- **Loss distribution** = frequency distribution of possible losses{{1}}
- **Forex Example**: portfolio value _at creation_ is{{3}}
 - USD 100 x 1 EUR / USD  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= EUR 100{{3}}
 - Risk factor = EUR / USD exchange rate{{4}}
 - Random realizations of exchange rate => **distribution** of portfolio losses _in the future_{{5}}

## Maximum Loss

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "4b5b89fed9"
```

`@part1`
- Given a portfolio with certain risk factors, what is the maximum amount it is likely to lose?{{1}}
- "Likely" is vague--the best we can do is to specify a maximum loss with a certain level of _confidence_, since risk factors are stochastic.{{2}}
- 100% confidence isn't useful: this only happens at the maximum loss it is possible to have!{{3}}
- Instead, a confidence level of _less_ than 100% is used, to answer questions such as:{{4}}
 - "What is the maximum loss that would take place 95% of the time?"{{4}}
 - In this question, the **confidence level** is 95%.{{4}}

## Value at Risk (VaR)

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "58510a0903"
```

`@part1`
- **VaR** is a statistical measure that states the maximum loss a portfolio can sustain, for a particular confidence level.{{1}}
- Typical confidence levels include **95%**, **99%**, and **99.5%**. They are also represented as decimals between 0 and 1:{{2}}
 - 0 represents 0%,
 - 1 represents 100%.
- As decimals, 95% = 0.95, 99% = 0.99 and 99.5% = 0.995.{{3}}
- **Forex Example**: If 95% of the time the EUR / USD exchange rate is _no less than_ 0.40 EUR / USD, then the value for the portfolio at a confidence level of 0.95 is:{{4}}

USD **100** x 0.40 EUR / USD = EUR **40**, i.e. the VaR is EUR **60**.{{4}}

## VaR: Confidence and Significance Levels

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "25967af781"
```

`@part1`
- The confidence level is a way of saying how likely an event is to occur: the event being a loss at **equal to or less than** the VaR statistic.
- Another way to say the same thing is how likely the event of a loss would **exceed** the VaR measure.
- This likelihood is called the **significance level**.
- If the confidence level is $\alpha$, then the significance level is 1 - $\alpha$.
- **Forex Example**: If the VaR for the portfolio is EUR **60** at a significance level of 0.05, the portfolio will be worth _less_ than EUR **40** (i.e. losses will be _higher_ than EUR **60**) 5% of the time.

## Deriving the VaR

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "a9ca967e46"
```

`@part1`
1. Specify a confidence level, or significance level
2. Compute the ```quantile``` of a series of observations (or a frequency distribution, or parameterized distribution, such as the Normal distribution), at the confidence or significance level specified in (1).
3. The computed ```quantile``` is the VaR at the desired confidence or significance level.

```python
losses = pd.Series(np.random.normal(0,1,1000))
VaR95 = losses.quantile(0.95)
```
