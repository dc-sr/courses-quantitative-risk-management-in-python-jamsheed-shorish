We’ve seen how to create loss distributions and how to test if a loss distribution is normally distributed. Now let’s examine how to use a loss distribution to measure how much a portfolio stands to lose, using the Value at Risk statistic.

## The Loss Distribution

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "2045c6fc14"
disable_transition: false
```

`@part1`
- **Loss distribution** = frequency distribution of possible losses{{1}}
- **Forex Example**: portfolio value _at creation_ is{{3}}
 - USD 100 x 1 EUR / USD  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= EUR 100{{3}}
 - Risk factor = EUR / USD exchange rate{{4}}
 - Random realizations of exchange rate => **distribution** of portfolio losses _in the future_{{5}}


`@part2`

`@script`
A loss distribution tells us a portfolio’s potential losses due to the random nature of its risk factors, when the holdings are held fixed over a particular time horizon. In our foreign exchange portfolio example, an investor with a portfolio holding U.S. Dollars exposes themselves to the dollar for euro exchange rate. Because the exchange rate is stochastic, there are different potential realisations of the exchange rate that each convey a different potential loss.

## Maximum Loss

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "4b5b89fed9"
```

`@part1`
- Given a portfolio with certain risk factors, what is the maximum amount it is likely to lose?{{1}}
- Losses cannot be bounded with 100% certainty, since risk factors are random.{{2}}
- Instead, a likelihood of _less_ than 100% is used--this is called the _confidence level_.{{3}}
- The confidence level allows us to answer questions such as:{{4}}
 - "What is the maximum loss that would take place 95% of the time?"{{4}}
 - In this question, the **confidence level** is 95%.{{4}}


`@script`
For financial institutions, it is important—and may be legally required—to place an upper bound on losses. Because risk factors are stochastic, and potential losses may be unbounded, it is usually not possible to bound losses with 100% certainty. Instead, we look for the likelihood that losses will remain capped by an upper bound. This likelihood is called the confidence level and is expressed as the percentage of portfolio realisations that don’t exceed this upper bound.

## Value at Risk (VaR)

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "58510a0903"
```

`@part1`
- **VaR** is a statistical measure that states the maximum loss a portfolio can sustain, for a particular confidence level.{{1}}
- Typical confidence levels include **95%**, **99%**, and **99.5%**. They are also represented as decimals between 0 and 1:{{2}}
 - 0 represents a 0% confidence level,
 - 1 represents a 100% confidence level.
- **Forex Example**: If 95% of the time the EUR / USD exchange rate is _no less than_ 0.40 EUR / USD, then the value for the portfolio at a confidence level of 0.95 is:{{3}}

USD **100** x 0.40 EUR / USD = EUR **40**, i.e. the VaR is EUR **60**.{{4}}


`@script`
A confidence level of (say) 95% allows us to ask what the largest loss might be, 95% of the time. THIS is the Value at Risk statistic, or “VaR”. VaR is usually expressed for 95%, 99% or 99.5% confidence levels, and these levels are often represented as decimals. In our portfolio example, if the Euro to Dollar exchange rate remains above certain level 95% of the time, the 95% VaR is 60 Euros, because the minimum portfolio value is its starting value of 100 Euros minus the 60 Euro VaR, or 40 Euros.

## VaR: Confidence and Significance Levels

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "25967af781"
```

`@part1`
- The confidence level gives the likelihood of an event: the event being a loss at **equal to or less than** the VaR statistic.{{1}}
- Another way to say the same thing is how likely the event of a loss would **exceed** the VaR.{{2}}
- This likelihood is called the **significance level**.{{3}}
- If the confidence level is $\alpha$, then the significance level is 1 - $\alpha$.{{4}}
- **Forex Example**: If the VaR for the portfolio is EUR **60** at a significance level of 0.05, the portfolio will be worth _less_ than EUR **40** (i.e. losses will be _higher_ than EUR **60**) 5% of the time.{{5}}


`@script`
The confidence level is a way of saying how likely an event is to occur--in this case the event we’re interested in is a loss capped by the VaR statistic. We can also ask how likely it is that the event of a loss would exceed the VaR statistic. This likelihood is called the significance level. When expressed as decimals, the significance level is one minus the confidence level. If the VaR for our example portfolio is 60 Euros at a significance level of 0.05, then the portfolio’s value will fall below 40 Euros (i.e. losses will be higher than 60 Euros) 5% of the time.

## Deriving the VaR

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "a9ca967e46"
code_zoom: 87
```

`@part1`
1. Specify a confidence level.{{1}}
2. Compute the ```quantile``` of a series of observations (or a frequency or probability distribution, such as the Normal distribution), at the specified confidence level.{{2}}
3. The computed ```quantile``` is the VaR at the desired confidence level.{{3}}

```python
losses = pd.Series(np.random.normal(0,1,1000))
VaR95 = losses.quantile(0.95)
print(VaR95)
```{{4}}

```out
1.6192834157254088
```{{4}}


`@script`
To derive the VaR, first specify the desired confidence level. Then calculate the quantile of the loss distribution corresponding to the confidence level—this is the VaR statistic. Recall from our earlier lesson on loss distributions that we can compute the quantile for a list of observations using the “quantile” method attached to a pandas Series object.

## Visualizing the VaR

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "c5a341ee4b"
disable_transition: false
```

`@part1`
- Loss distribution histogram for 1000 draws from N(1,3){{1}}


`@part2`
![histogram_normal_losses.png](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/5100/datasets/a3aa6617fede7d82caa00f8e14988494f6042206/histogram_normal_losses.png){{1}}


`@script`
We visualize the VaR by plotting the loss distribution and showing where the quantile value is located with a vertical line added to the plot. Here we plot a histogram of 1000 draws from a Normal distribution, to represent the loss distribution.

and 99.5%. Notice how the vertical line moves further and further to the right, showing how the VaR increases as the confidence level grows.

Now it’s your turn! You can test your knowledge of the VaR by creating and plotting a loss distribution, computing VaR statistics, and adding them to your loss distribution plot.
